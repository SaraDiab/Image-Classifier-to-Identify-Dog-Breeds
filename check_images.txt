Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
No,

VGG: Classified as "miniature poodle"
ResNet: Classified as "miniature poodle"
AlexNet: Classified as "miniature poodle"


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Both VGG and ResNet classify Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed, specifically as "toy poodle."
 However, AlexNet classifies Dog_01.jpg differently, identifying it as a "toucan" instead.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:  yes


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on the provided answers, I'm torn between VGG and ResNet. The classification results are similar, and the processing time is also close.
However, ResNet appears to be slightly better than VGG, with just a one-second difference.
